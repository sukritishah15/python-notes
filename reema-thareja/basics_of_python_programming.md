### Numbers

Numeric Value
4 types -
1. Integers - Example - 5
    (Integers can be specified in octal and hexadecimal number system as well.)
2. Long integers - Example - 535633629843L
    (Long integers must have 'l' or 'L' as suffix)
3. Floating point numbers - Example - 3.23, 91.5E-2 
    ('E' notation indicates power of 10. So, 91.5E-2 means 91.5 * (10 ^ -2) i.e. 91.5 * (10 ** -2) )
    ```
    >>> n = 91.5E-2
    >>> n
    0.915
    >>> 91.5 * (10 ** -2)
    0.915
    ```
4. Complex numbers - (a + bi) form - Example - (-3 + 7i)
